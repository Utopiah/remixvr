            RemixVR activities help students practice social skills such as
            respectful communication, perspective taking, cooperation, and
            critical thinking, as they experience positive connections with
            peers around the world. All of our activities are standards- and
            research-based, and they fit easily into existing curriculum. Our
            activity plans can be followed step-by-step or tailored to meet your
            classroomâ€™s needs, and classrooms can do an RemixVR activity as
            frequently as they would like. We encourage partner classrooms to
            stay connected throughout the year to deepen relationships among
            students and explore new topics!
