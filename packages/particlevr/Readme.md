## ParticleVR

In this VR template, you can create various effects like rain, snow on top of 360 images.

We're using aframe-particle-system-component to create the effects. This component uses [Shader Particle Engine](https://github.com/squarefeet/ShaderParticleEngine) internally to create the effects using three.js.
